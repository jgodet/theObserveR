# STEP 1 : PS estimation

## Covariate selection
General guidelines for covariate selection[@Lee2017]
- Do not include variables thought to be related to the treatment but not to the outcome
- Do not include variables that may be influenced by the treatment (time variant variables measured after treatment)
- Exclude variables that perfectly predict treatment status (overlap minimum)

## Parametric vs non parametric estimation
- Parmetric : via generalized linear modeling (i.e., logistic regression, probit regression, or discriminant analysis) +/-including product (polynomial or interaction) terms of the covariates. ==> Overfitting !! Another concern is that researchers often make uninformed decisions on the product terms to be included.

- Non parametric : via generalized boosted modeling (GBM). Combinaison of regression tree providing a smoothed function for the final PS estimation.This approach allows for multiway product terms modeled “naturally” as a result of sample splitting.

See Harder et al. (2010) for the comparison of parametric vs. non-parametric PS estimation when they are applied with
different PS techniques.


# STEP 2 : Checking balance on the propensity scores and covariates

## Balance on the propensity scores
- exploration of higher moments (experimental exploration with dataset)

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
